224308.BSU41040	oxaAA	261	Sec-independent factor for membrane protein insertion (YidC/SpoIIIJ family); Required for the insertion and/or proper folding and/or complex formation of integral membrane proteins into the membrane. Involved in integration of membrane proteins that insert both dependently and independently of the Sec translocase complex, as well as at least some lipoproteins (By similarity). Also involved in protein secretion processes. Essential for sporulation by activating sigma factor SpoIIIG/SigG after engulfment is completed in the prespore, maybe by acting on SpoIIIAE. It has an overlapping, al [...] 
224308.BSU41050	rnpA	116	Protein component of ribonuclease P (RNase P) (substrate specificity); RNaseP catalyzes the removal of the 5'-leader sequence from pre-tRNA to produce the mature 5'-terminus. It can also cleave other RNA substrates such as 4.5S RNA. The protein component plays an auxiliary but essential role in vivo by binding to the 5'-leader sequence and broadening the substrate specificity of the ribozyme.
224308.BSU41060	rpmH	44	Ribosomal protein L34; Evidence 2a: Function of homologous gene experimentally demonstrated in an other organism; structure.
